We are a hard fork of the great project [dbcli/pgcli](https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli).  This `pgcli` base gives us a lot of workaday features of PostgreSQL's great CLI [`psql`](https://postgresql.org).   We then add Oracle(tm) [SQL*Plus]()(tm) like features with aiming to take nothing away from the existing `psql` compatibility features of `pgcli`.


Have we reverse engineered `SQL*Plus` to produce this project?  **Absolutely NOT**!!   Why would we want (or need) to do that? `SQL*Plus` is a simple CLI with simple features, this is part of it's greatness.   A great little book is Jonathan Gennick's [SQL*Plus Pocket Reference](https://www.amazon.com/Oracle-SQL-Plus-Pocket-Reference/dp/0596008856).
